For this homework assignment, we will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

Instructions

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:

- The ticker symbol

- Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

- The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.

Homework Module 2 - VBA scripting
    In this folder you will find declared formulas for VBA functions in Excel (macros), all this with the objective to get the multiple year stock data give to us as a project for homework.
        This is an example how to get some specific information, using formulas that contain:
        1. Variables (Strings)
        2. Looping (If, Else)
        3. Conditionals (colors, numbers)

        You can see an example of basic formulas you can use to simplify the work, trying to connect sheets or even workbooks.
